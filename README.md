Summary
We found that return is higher in 2017 than 2018.
The advantages of refactoring code is that it is fast, and the result produced is "standardized", that is, we know all the process will be the same and thus has certain consistency. On the other hand, the refactoring process might ignore problem of outliers--some data set might exists unique observation that requries dealing with manually.
